## Module Programming and Scripting, teacher Andrew Beatty

## Author Jennifer Ibanez Cano

## Student of Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at the ATU Galway, 2024. 

In this repository I uploaded the weekly tasks for the module Programming and Scripting.

## Get starting.

The tools that I needed to intall in my computer to complete the module tasks and project were the following: 

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). 
* Install the latest version of Git.
* [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
* Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. 
* Cloning the teacher's repository
* Create the [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

## References that I used for the weekly task. 

### Weekly task 1

This task constists of creating a program that displays Hello World! when it is run. Here I followed the instructions provided by the teacher in lecture. 

### Weekly task 2

This task (bank.py) constists of creating a program that will ask the user for two money amounts (in cent). The program will print out the sum of theses amounts with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.

### Weekly task 3

This task (accounts.py) constists of creating a program that will read a 10 character account number and it'll output the account number with only the last 4 digits showing, the first 6 digits will be replaced with Xs.

### Weekly task 4

This task (collatz.py) constists of creating a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. The program ends if the current value is one.

### Weekly task 6

This task (squareroot.py) constists of writing a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

### Weekly task 7

This task (es.py) constists of writing a program that reads in a text file (moby-dick.txt) and outputs the number of e's it contains. The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line.

### Weekly task 8

This task (es.py) constists of writing a program that displays:
    * a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, 
    * and a plot of the function  h(x)=x3 in the range 0 to 10, on the one set of axes.

In this repository I uploaded the weekly task for the module Programming and scriptting.

The tools that I needed to intall in my computer to complete the module tasks and project were the following: 

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). 
* Install the latest version of Git.
* [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
* Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. 
* Cloning the teacher's repository
* Create the [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

### Weekly task 4

This task (collatz.py) consist to create a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. The program ends if the current value is one.
